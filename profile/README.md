# JDemetra+

**JDemetra+ is a seasonal adjustment and time series analysis tool** developed by the National Bank of Belgium in collaboration with the Deutsche Bundesbank, Insee and Eurostat in accordance with the [Guidelines of the European Statistical System](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/w/ks-gq-24-012) (ESS).

Since 2015, JDemetra+ has been [officially recommended](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17409112/2015-01-21.Jdemetra%2B.release.pdf) to the members of the ESS and the European System of Central Banks as the software for seasonal and calendar adjustment of official statistics.

JDemetra+ implements the concepts and algorithms used in the two leading SA methods: TRAMO/SEATS and X-12ARIMA. These methods have been re-engineered using an object-oriented approach, which makes them easier to use, extend and modify.

In addition to seasonal adjustment, JDemetra+ bundles other time series models useful for the production or analysis of economic statistics, such as outlier detection, nowcasting, temporal disaggregation or benchmarking. 

Version 3 offers enhanced seasonal adjustment and trend estimation capabilities, including for high frequency data.

Technically, JDemetra+ is a collection of reusable and extensible Java components, easily accessed through a rich graphical interface. The software is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) developed under the EUPL licence.
